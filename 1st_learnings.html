    <p>We were both young when I first saw you
        I close my eyes and the flashback starts
        I'm standing there
        On a balcony in summer air
        See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
        See you make your way through the crowd
        And say, "Hello"
        Little did I know
        That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
        And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
        And I was crying on the staircase
        Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
        Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
        I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
        You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
        It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
        So I sneak out to the garden to see you
        We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
        So close your eyes
        Escape this town for a little while, oh, ohWe were both young when I first saw you

        I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
        You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
        It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
        So I sneak out to the garden to see you
        We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
        So close your eyes
        Escape this town for a little while, oh, ohWe were both young when I first saw you
        I close my eyes and the flashback starts
        I'm standing there
        On a balcony in summer air
        See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
        See you make your way through the crowd

        Little did I know
        That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
        And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"

        Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
        Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
        I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
